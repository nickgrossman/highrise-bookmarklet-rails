# the /awesome project

The goal of the /awesome (pronounced "slash awesome") project is to surface the stories and stats the demonstrate how often the web is.

What if every website who wanted to (from huge providers like Google, to networks like Etsy, to independent bloggers and individuals) added a new page to their website, located at **/awesome**.

each /awesome page would answer a simple question:

**“What has happened in our community that is new and awesome, and wouldn’t have been possible without the web?”**

This would be the place for each community to pick the “holy shit” stories -- and they are so, so many -- and surface them, for the benefit of the entire movement.   This would be about real people and real stories -- coming from the bottom up / edges in.  

## /awesome tools:

Each /awesome page could be totally unique and different -- and could be designed / moderated / edited / curated in whichever way is appropriate to that community.

As an open source project, we can develop a handful of tools to help people bootstrap their pages.

For example, templates:
 * blog / tumblog format
 * slideshow format
 * pinterest board-like format
 * timeline-format
 * etc

Also, we'll think about some data standards:

I will be important for /awesome pages to publish machine-readable data that describes the awesomeness, so that it can be aggregated & built upon by others.

So, a spec -- maybe as simple as RSS for content, and perhaps something more tailored eventually for different kinds of data.
